# Testing


## What interviewer is looking for...

- Big Picture understanding
- Knowing how pieces fit together
- Organization
    - structured approach: taking photos, image management, settings
- Practicality
    - can you create reasonable testing plans?


## Testing a Real World Object

step 1: who will use it? why?
step 2: what are use cases?
step 3: what are bounds of use?
step 4: what are stress/failure conditions
step 5: how would you perform the testing? (automated, uses per year, simplify heuristic)

## Testing a Piece of Software

Black box vs. white box testing\
- black box, give software as-is and test
- white box, additional programmatic access to test individual functions

step 1: are we doing black box or white box testing? \
step 2: who will use it? and why? \
step 3: what are the use cases? \
step 4: what are the bounds of use? \
step 5: what are the stress conditions/failure conditions? \
step 6: what are the test cases? How would you perform the testing? 

## Testing a Function

step 1: define the test cases 
> normal case, extremes, nulls and "illegal" input, strange input (already sorted input, input sorted in reverse order?)\

step 2:define the expected result\
step 3: write test code
